# PurgeAnnouncer

A fork of Shauren's [InterruptAnnouncer](https://github.com/Shauren/InterruptAnnouncer) that does the same thing but for purges/dispels. Note that, as a healer, this does not filter to just dispels on enemy targets, so it will also announce when your dispel yourself or friendly targets.

To install, place the `.toc` and `.lua` files in a new "PurgeAnnouncer" folder in your Interface/Addons/ folder.
